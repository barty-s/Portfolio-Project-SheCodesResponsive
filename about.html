              I'm originally from Ireland but have been living in different
              places, mostly around Europe, since 2013. I'm currently based in
              Vigo, in the north-west of Spain. I'm very new to the coding world
              since joining SheCodes in October, 2022 but I've loved every
              minute of it!

            <h4>My studies</h4>
            <div class="description-paragraph mb-3">
              I graduated from Trinity College, Dublin in 2012 with a degree in
              History of Art and Architecture and Italian. I then completed a
              course to teach English as a foreign language and moved to Spain.
              I've lived and worked in various cities around Spain. I also lived
              in Belgrade, Serbia for a year where I studied for a Master's in
              Cultural Policy and Management. My lastet educational challenge is
              with SheCodes, learning to be a Front-End Developer.

            <h4>My Work Experience</h4>
            <div class="description-paragraph mb-3">
              I've been teaching English as a foreign language since 2013. I've
              mainly worked in Spain in cities such as Oviedo, Carmona, San
              Sebastian (pictured), and currently, Vigo. I've also worked in
              Ireland and the UK on summer courses. I'm now looking to move into
              the tech industry and, hopefully, make a career change...here's to
              new challenges in 2023!

            <h4>My Hobbies</h4>
            <div class="description-paragraph mb-3">
              I've always loved water sports, from swimming to surfing to
              sailing. I took up windsurfing in 2019 and haven't looked back.
              Where I live has perfect conditions for windsurfing year-round and
              it's a great way to get out into nature, even in the depths of the
              stormy winter months, which is actually my favourite time of year
              to sail with stormy, windy conditions! I'm also into running, and
              have done three half-marathons so far.
